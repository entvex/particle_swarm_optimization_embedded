\section{Description}\label{sc:problemdescription}
The purpose of this project is to take the well-known Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm\citeawesome{Blondin2009} and hardware accelerate it on the Zybo xc7z010clg-400-1 board. Achieving this by using the board and accompanying Xilinx tools, the algorithm will be split into parts, that run in software and others in hardware.\\

As seen in the rich picture on figure \ref{fig:descriptiondiagram}. A researcher often sits in their lab solving problems of mathematical nature. The projects varies from groundbreaking university research to helping the industry partners solve problems. An ongoing theme is the need to find a objective function hence the desire to maximize or minimize.\\

In this example, the researcher's preferred tool is the particle swarm optimization algorithm, because it can find the global maximum or minimum, the drawback however is that it takes a long time to do the calculations on the devices they have available. Therefore using a Zybo xc7z010clg-400-1 board where the critical parts of the algorithm will be hardware accelerated. Using this solution they can optimize problems much faster saving time that can be spent elsewhere.
