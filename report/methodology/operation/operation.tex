\subsection{Operation}\label{sc:operation}
The operations contains both the Use Cases and Requirements because they both describe how the system operates. They both also reflect the established requirements.

\subsubsection{Use Cases}\label{ssc:usecases}
Use cases\citepawesome{Friedenthal2014}{303} represent the goals the system is intended to solve. A use case also has the notion of actors who are users of the system. An example is a researcher who access a system of interest to help solve some problem. It can also have actors that indirectly use the system such as managers or industry partners.

\subsubsection{Requirements}\label{ssc:requirements}
The Requirements is presented as a requirements list. Requirements specify conditions that must be fulfilled. Requirements are goals that should be achieved.
