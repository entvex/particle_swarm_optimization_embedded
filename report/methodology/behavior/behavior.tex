\subsection{Behavior}\label{sc:behavior}
In SysML it is possible to model the behavior of the system using Activity Diagrams which describe the actions in a given Activity that controls the flow of input/output from one Activity to another. Sequence Diagrams main focus is the communication between different objects in time. State Machines main focus is the different states the system can obtain.

\subsubsection{Activity Diagram}\label{ssc:activitydiagram}
Activity diagram created to show the control flowing from one Activity to another and they are good at visualizing the logic such as of conditional structures, loops and concurrency. A way to look at it is to think about it as a complex flowchart.

\subsubsection{Sequence Diagram}\label{ssc:sequencediagram}
Sequence diagrams are used to model how parts of a block interact by the means of API calls signals or messages. This is useful to get an overview of how software works by using methods or functions between software components. But be noted that Sequence Diagrams are not strictly for software.

\subsubsection{State Machine Diagram}\label{ssc:statemachinediagram}
State Machine Diagram is used to model state behaviors throughout a blocks life cycle. This is useful when a system or sub-system has different states of operation, to structure and show the functionality that is required in different states of the system.
