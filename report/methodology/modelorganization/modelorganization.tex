\subsection{Model Organization}
To manage the complete model and sub-models of the full system, the package diagram\citepawesome{Friedenthal2014}{103} will be used. A package diagram is a system organization model of SysML standards. In this project the package diagram will be used to formulate and verify which diagrams and models are used as a methodology to describe the system of interest. Another effect the package diagram have on this project, is the organization structure it brings.\\

Multiple package diagrams are used to explain dependencies of components and sub-systems in a complex system. Since this project is of a smaller scale, only a single package diagram is needed. However this feature can be useful in case this project is used as a component or sub-system in a complex system.
