\subsection{Structure}\label{sc:structure}
To explain the structure of the system, the usage of both block definition diagram (bdd) and internal block diagram (ibd) will be used. Both bdd and ibd will be used as structure diagrams and won't include context to the environment because of the system scale.

\subsubsection{Block Definition Diagram}\label{ssc:blockdefinitiondiagram}
The block definition diagram\citepawesome{Friedenthal2014}{119} (bdd) is used to display a high-level top view, of the overall system. In this project the bdd will be used to make a simple structure model. The bdd will be used to explain core behavior and relationship between blocks.

\subsubsection{Internal Block Diagram}\label{ssc:internalblockdiagram}
The internal block diagram\citepawesome{Friedenthal2014}{119} (ibd), is used to explain internal and external connections between blocks, from the prior block definition diagram. In this project, it will be used to make a more detailed structure model, on top of the information gathered by the block definition diagram.
