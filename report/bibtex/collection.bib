@book{Friedenthal2014,
abstract = {A Practical Guide to SysML, Third Edition, fully updated for SysML version 1.4, provides a comprehensive and practical guide for modeling systems with SysML. With their unique perspective as leading contributors to the language, Friedenthal, Moore, and Steiner provide a full description of the language along with a quick reference guide and practical examples to help you use SysML. The book begins with guidance on the most commonly used features to help you get started quickly. Part 1 explains the benefits of a model-based approach, providing an overview of the language and how to apply SysML to model systems. Part 2 includes a comprehensive description of SysML that provides a detailed understanding that can serve as a foundation for modeling with SysML, and as a reference for practitioners. Part 3 includes methods for applying model-based systems engineering using SysML to specify and design systems, and how these methods can help manage complexity. Part 4 deals with topics related to transitioning MBSE practice into your organization, including integration of the system model with other engineering models, and strategies for adoption of MBSE.Learn how and why to deploy MBSE in your organization with an introduction to systems and model-based systems engineering Use SysML to describe systems with this general overview and a detailed description of the Systems Modeling Language Review practical examples of MBSE methodologies to understand their application to specifying and designing a systemIncludes comprehensive modeling notation tables as an appendix that can be used as a standalone reference},
