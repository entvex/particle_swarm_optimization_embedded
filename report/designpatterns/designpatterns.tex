In the following solution the patterns used are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item State Pattern
	\item Singleton
	\item Command Pattern
\end{itemize}

In this project it has been concluded that the implementation of the State Pattern, Singleton and Command Pattern\citeawesome{RalphJohnsonErichGammaJohnVlissides} profits the project. Each of the patterns are covered in the sections following.

\subsection{GOF State Pattern}\label{dp:state}
The intent of the state pattern is to grant an object the ability to change its behavior when it's internal state changes hence the object will therefore change its class. Consider the state machine diagram in Figure \ref{fig:smdguistate}, page \pageref{fig:smdguistate}, that represents the GUI of the PSOS. The PSOS can be in one of the distinct states: Setup, FindMinima, FindMaxima. \\

When the Zynq CPU starts it enters the Setup state. This receives actions from other classes such as \texttt{ActionUp}, \texttt{ActionDown}, \texttt{ActionNext} and the respond will differ base on the action. For example, the result of an \texttt{StartAction} depends on what the current state is in. In the FindMinima or FindMaxima state the action can occur, the Setup state however does not accept it.\\

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:statemachine}, is the state machine in the project. It was a good choice to use the GOF State Pattern because of the ease to model a state machine and bring it into code.

\subsection{GOF Singleton}\label{dp:singleton}
The intent of the singleton is to guarantee that a class only has one instance therefor providing a single global point of access to it. This is accomplished by making the class itself responsible for keeping track of its instance. The class can guarantee that no other instance can be constructed and therefore it can only have a single way to access the instance.\\

In the project, the GOF Singleton was used to acquire deep history in order for the researcher's variable settings to be kept in the Setup class. It can be seen in the class diagram in Figure \ref{fig:singleton}, where the constructor is private and the only way to get access to the instance of the class, is by using its \texttt{Instance()} method. This guarantees that the acquired instance of the object is always of the same object, unless the destructor have been called.

\subsection{GOF Command Pattern}\label{dp:command}
The intent of GOF Command Pattern is to Encapsulate a request and therefore letting one set different parameters for clients with different requests types. An example could be a message, log requests or other requests. It has support undoable operations (operations that can't be undone ).\\

This allows software engineers to create objects that can interact with the application in a parameterize manner. The command can be stored and moved around like other objects. The main thing about this pattern is the abstract Command class which other commands inherit from. The abstract Command has a interface for executing operations hence an abstract Execute method. Concrete Command subclasses specify a Execute method with the needs for the specific Command. \\
 
In Figure \ref{fig:commands} the commands in the PSOS is shown. The Actions are \texttt{ActionDownCommand}, \texttt{ActionNextCommand}, \texttt{ActionStartCommand} and \texttt{ActionUpCommand}. The Actions are used to change settings in the setup state and start the search for FindMinima and FindMaxima. The transitions commands are \texttt{FindMaximaCommand}, \texttt{ReturnResultCommand} and \texttt{FindMinimaCommand}. By using commands the code handling specific functionality are streamlined and only exist one place, hence it makes it easier to maintain and guards against code duplication.
