\section{Description}
The purpose of this project is to take the well-known Particle Swarm Optimization \cite{Blondin2009} and make it do the calculations on the Zybo xc7z010clg-400-1 board. By using this board and the accompanying Xilinx tools the algorithm will be split into parts that run in software and others in hardware.

As seen in the rich picture on figure \ref{fig:descriptiondiagram}. A researcher often sits in his or her lab solving problems of mathematical nature. The projects varies from groundbreaking university research to helping the industry partners solve problems. An ongoing theme is the need to find a objective function hence the desired to maximize or minimize.
The researcher preferred tool is particle swarm optimization because it can find the global maximum or minimum, but the drawback is that it takes a long time calculate on the devices he has available. Therefore using a new Zybo xc7z010clg-400-1 board where the critical parts of the algorithm would be implemented in hardware save time that the researcher could have spent elsewhere.
