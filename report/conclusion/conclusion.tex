\section{Conclusion}
In the project we tried to make particle swarm optimization faster using hardware acceleration. A key part here was also the use of 


As shown in the synthesizer we need quite a many lookup table (LUT), Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and flip-flops. But it is indeed still a design that would possible to run on a bigger FPGA. The ultrascale+ VU37P\citepawesome{XilinxInc.2017}{3} can handle the designs shown in Figure \ref{fig:psossynthesissummary} that was the
