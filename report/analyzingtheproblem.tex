\subsection{Analyzing the Problem}
When starting a project it is important to analysis the problem description and, for this project it can be found on page \pageref{sc:problemdescription}. A domain model can be extracted from the description and it helps build the boundary between the system of interest and external systems and stakeholders who interact with directly or indirectly. 
%MÃ¥ske skal dette stykke ned til use cases?
Another thing the analysis will help define is the most important use cases which represent the goals the system is intended to solve.
